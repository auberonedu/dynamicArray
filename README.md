# dynamicArray (Alston, Kaalid) 1/14/2025/02:07:pm

An assignment to understand how dynamic arrays work. Have one partner fork this repo and invite the other as a collaborator. When you are finished, make a PR against the original repository and have BOTH PARTNERS submit a link to the PR on Canvas.

## Instructions

For this assignment you will make a new class `DynamicStringList` that implements the provided `StringList` interface and write tests for it. You will need to make a new file for your class! Do NOT edit `StringList.java`

Use a static backing array to implement your solution. DO NOT USE ANY COLLECTIONS METHODS OR CLASSES (e.g. do not use `ArrayList`).

Write JUnit tests to verify the functionality of your list.
